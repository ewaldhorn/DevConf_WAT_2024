# DevConf 2024 - WAT

Raw WebAssembly, in Text... WAT!

WebAssembly module written in text, part of the live demo for my DevConf 2024 talk.

## WebAssembly Text Format

Please visit the [MDN Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/Understanding_the_text_format) page to learn more about WAT file format. It's neat to help you understand some parts of WASM, but I prefer using a slightly higher-level language to write my wasm modules in!
